Abstract: "This project aims to analyze which treatment option for prostate cancer leads to the highest recovery rate among patients. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men and is ranked as the "second most frequently diagnosed cancer"(Rawla, 2019). It also remains the "fifth leading cause of death worldwide" (Rawla, 2019), making the identification of the most effective treatment essential. As research in cancer therapy continues to expand, it is imperative to compare the overall effectiveness of different treatment methods, including hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, surgery, and combination therapies, to determine whether a single or combined approach yields better recovery outcomes. This study will evaluate tumor size, initial PSA levels, and biopsy Gleason scores over a one-year period to compare patient recovery and cancer recurrence. Statistical analyses will identify patterns of effectiveness among various treatments and determine which method best improves survival rates while reducing recurrence. It is hypothesized that combination treatments will decrease survival and decrease recurrence, whereas single therapies may yield higher recurrence rates but increased survival rates. By analyzing these relationships, this project seeks to highlight how treatment choice influences recovery rates, recurrence, and long-term survival outcomes for prostate cancer patients."
